Welcome to the Park Republic Web Application

This folder has been renamed from it’s previous title ‘html’ where it resides on an AWS web server, with a file path var/www/html.  It consists of the web application, currently contained in the folder ‘Park_Rep_30_6_2015’, the mobile scripts which accessed through AJAX requests, and a Stripe library which is reference when charging a driver’s credit card. 

As all the installs to guarantee the operation of the prototype have occurred on the AWS EC2 instance, the full functionality of the app is only guaranteed where it is hosted on that server.  Therefore, the site can also be accessed at http://ec2-54-77-234-254.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/Park_Rep_30_6_2015/index.html.

Happy parking!
